In general wrong inputs, like a negative temperature, are accepted but if you try run a programm it will tell you to give a proper input.
The oven and dishwasher have times set between 8 and 15 seconds for the different programms.

Robot:
The robot uses 3% battery and cleans 2% every 0.25 second. Recharges 5% per 0.25 at base.
If it's empty it will go back to base and recharge and once recharged continue cleaning automatically.
The timer only measures time SPENT CLEANING. It was unclear so we though this would make more sense.
If you try to clean a completely clean room it will tell you and set the room to dirty.
