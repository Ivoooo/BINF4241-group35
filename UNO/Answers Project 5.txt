## Part One: Test Snake and Ladder Game

## Part Two: Fix code of Tic tac toe
###GameBoardTest
In GameBoardTest.java the following testcases were failling: 

markTwice
markOnBoard
getOpenPositions 
getOpenPositionsAll

markTwice and markOnBoard passed after the return statement in public boolean mark in GameBoard was changed. mark returned True when a non-empty field was chosen and false when a "good" field was chosen and assigned to the player. 

I fixed getOpenPositions and getOpenPositionsAll by setting the int col  in Gameboard() Public Gameboard in the iteration loops to 0 instead of 1. 

###GameStateTests
in GameStateTests the following test cases were failing: 
getavailableStatesLastOne
hasWinDiagonal
isOverWin
startingPlayerIsX
hasWinRow
hasWinCol
switchPlayer
PlayOnBoard
playSameLocation

The main error was because of the getcurrentPlayer method in Gamestate. The method was set to return PlayerO no matter what the actual current player was. after deleting the statement that did this the following test cases passed: getavailableStatesLastOne, startingPlayerIsX, switchPlayer, PlayOnBoard, playSameLocation

hasWinCol and hasWinRow passed after i changed the return in the method hasWin to true instead of false when either a column or a row where completed. 

hasWinDiagonal and isOverWin passed after i changed the second return statement in the completesDiagonal method, in the return statement Board.getMark got the field 1,2 instead of 2,2 which meant it didnt actually check for the diagonal. 

## Part Three: Uno
1. 
a) The input (card) is only valid if the player is obtaining the card in his deck. It also should accept the input if the player doesn't have the card or he isn't willing to play a card even if he has a matching one in his deck. But if the player gives as the input a card he doesn't possess in his deck then the input is invalid. It is also invalid if the player wants to play several cards in once.
b) If the input is valid then the card goes to the Discard Pile. If the input is that he doesn't possess the card or he doesn't want to play then he has to take a card from the draw pile. If the input is invalid he has to make a right input.
c) if the input is valid:
Normal card: "Succesfully layed down a normal Card"
Reverse card: "You have successfully changed the direction of the play"
Skip card: "The player coming next is blocked in this round"
Draw Two: "The player coming next has to take 2 cards in addition"
Wild card: "You can now choose which colour should be played next"
Wild Draw 4 card: "You can now choose which colour should be played next and the player coming next has to take 4 cards in addition"
if the input is invalid the output should be:" The input is invalid please give a right input"
